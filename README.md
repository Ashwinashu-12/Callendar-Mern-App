Here’s a **proper README.md** for your **MyApp** project that you can directly use on GitHub:

# 📅 MyApp

MyApp is a **MERN stack calendar and task management application** with a clean UI and smooth user experience.  
It allows users to sign up, log in, manage their profile, add/delete tasks, and view Indian festivals directly in the calendar.  
A red dot appears on specific calendar dates where either a **task** or a **festival** is present, making it easy to track events at a glance.
